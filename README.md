# ProvInCiA: Provenance in Smart Cities Approach  

**ProvInCiA** (Provenance in Smart Cities Approach) is a research-driven framework designed to enable **end-to-end data traceability** in Smart Cities.  
It unifies the collection, management, and querying of **provenance data** by integrating both **prospective provenance** (workflow specification) and **retrospective provenance** (execution details).  

## Key Features
- **Multi-strategy capture**: supports code instrumentation, active monitoring (eavesdrop), and log file analysis (crawler).  
- **Provenance extraction**: transforms raw execution data into standardized **W3C PROV** entities (activities, entities, agents).  
- **Meta-dataflow reconstruction**: correlates independent dataflows into a global view of urban processes.  
- **Auditing and decision support**: enables reproducibility, accountability, and compliance through provenance queries and interactive visualization.  
- **Scalable storage and queries**: integrates with databases such as MonetDB and supports SQL-based querying.  

## Use Cases
ProvInCiA has been evaluated in **Smart City applications**, such as urban flood monitoring using IoT cameras, supporting data audits and improving the reliability of AI-based decision-making.
